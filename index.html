    <h1>Welcome to the WUSTL CIG's DL-PTED Project!</h1>
    
    <p>
        Deep learning may revolutionize the study of musculoskeletal conditions by automating the evaluation pipeline.
        This project seeks to develop tissue and modality-specific DL algorithms for automatic evaluation of disease stage
        and explore multi-modal in post-traumatic elbow conditions using histology, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.
        This project is in collaboration with the Musculoskeletal Soft Tissue Laboratory.
